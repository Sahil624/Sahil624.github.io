    content: >-
      I'm a seasoned software developer with a strong foundation in computer
      science and mathematics, passionate about web development and innovative
      tech solutions. I previously served as a Lead Software Engineer at uTrade
      Solutions in Mohali, India, where I led projects in algorithmic trading,
      optimized database operations, and guided teams in microservice
      architecture transitions to enhance trading performance and system
      efficiency.


      Currently, I'm advancing my expertise through a master’s in Computer Science with a concentration in AI. My research focuses on integrating AI into adaptive learning platforms, expanding my skills at the cutting edge of technology. Whether I'm mentoring junior developers, optimizing tech solutions, or exploring new AI applications, I bring a comprehensive skill set and a collaborative spirit to every endeavor.

        date: "Expected Graduation: 2026"
        content: >
          I am currently pursuing my Master of Science in Computer Science at Kennesaw State University, 
          with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence. My graduate journey culminates in my thesis, 
          QUINTET, a novel educational platform designed to democratize access to Quantum Computing. 
          Recognizing that traditional tools are often fragmented and math-heavy, I developed a 
          'zero-setup' environment that combines gamified intuition, a hybrid network simulator, 
          and RAG-based AI agents to guide students through complex concepts. This research has 
          allowed me to merge my background in software engineering with advanced AI, building 
          systems that are not just technically robust but pedagogically impactful.
